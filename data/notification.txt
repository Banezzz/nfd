1. Verify the identity of the other party on the NodeSeek forum before trading, do not trade directly with users outside the forum.
2. Verify that the seller has the product before trading, if possible try to log in first.
3. Try to avoid trading through cryptocurrency, as cryptocurrency transactions cannot be reported or recovered.
4. For large transactions, try to use forum intermediaries. If the other party is unwilling to use an intermediary, the risk is higher, so trade with caution.

If you suspect that the person you're chatting with is a scammer, please don't hesitate to report it immediately to the NodeSeek forum or to the group @nodeseekg. We will update the scammer database promptly to prevent further losses.
